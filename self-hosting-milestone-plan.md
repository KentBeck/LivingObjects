# Self-Hosting Smalltalk Milestone Plan (Simple & Test-Driven)

## Goal

Build a Smalltalk system that can read Smalltalk source code, compile it to bytecode, and execute it - essentially creating a self-hosting Smalltalk implementation that can rebuild itself from source.

**Key Principles**:

1. **Test-driven development** - Every change is validated by tests
2. **Simplicity first** - Choose the simplest solution that works
3. **Correctness over speed** - Get it working right, ignore performance
