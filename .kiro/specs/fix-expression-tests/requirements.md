# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The C++ Smalltalk virtual machine has a comprehensive expression test suite with 37 test cases. Currently, several test categories that are marked as "should pass" are failing due to parsing errors or missing implementations. This feature will systematically fix all failing expression tests to ensure the VM can properly handle the core Smalltalk language constructs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Smalltalk VM developer, I want all basic language constructs to be properly parsed and executed, so that the expression test suite passes completely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the expression test suite is run THEN all tests marked with `shouldPass: true` SHALL pass
2. WHEN parsing array creation syntax like `Array new: 3` THEN the parser SHALL handle the colon syntax correctly
3. WHEN parsing string operations like `'hello' , ' world'` THEN the parser SHALL handle the comma operator
4. WHEN parsing variable declarations like `| x | x := 42. x` THEN the parser SHALL handle pipe-delimited variable lists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Smalltalk VM developer, I want block expressions to work correctly, so that closures and functional programming constructs are supported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing block literals like `[3 + 4]` THEN the parser SHALL create proper block objects
2. WHEN executing `[3 + 4] value` THEN the system SHALL return the integer 7
3. WHEN parsing parameterized blocks like `[:x | x + 1]` THEN the parser SHALL handle block parameters
4. WHEN executing `[:x | x + 1] value: 5` THEN the system SHALL return the integer 6

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Smalltalk VM developer, I want collection literals and operations to work, so that arrays and other collections can be used effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing array literals like `#(1 2 3)` THEN the parser SHALL create proper array objects
2. WHEN executing `#(1 2 3) at: 2` THEN the system SHALL return the integer 2
3. WHEN executing `#(1 2 3) size` THEN the system SHALL return the integer 3
4. WHEN parsing symbol literals like `#abc` THEN the parser SHALL create proper symbol objects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Smalltalk VM developer, I want conditional expressions to work, so that control flow constructs are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing conditional expressions like `true ifTrue: [42]` THEN the parser SHALL handle the ifTrue: message
2. WHEN executing `(3 < 4) ifTrue: [10] ifFalse: [20]` THEN the system SHALL return the integer 10
3. WHEN executing `(5 < 2) ifTrue: [10] ifFalse: [20]` THEN the system SHALL return the integer 20
4. WHEN executing `true ifTrue: [42]` THEN the system SHALL return the integer 42

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Smalltalk VM developer, I want string operations to be implemented, so that string manipulation is possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing `'hello' , ' world'` THEN the system SHALL return the string "hello world"
2. WHEN executing `'hello' size` THEN the system SHALL return the integer 5
3. WHEN the string concatenation operator `,` is used THEN it SHALL properly combine two strings
4. WHEN the size message is sent to a string THEN it SHALL return the correct length
