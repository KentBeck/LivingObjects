# Living Objects Manifesto

An object's true potential lies not in its static definition, but in its living presence.

When alive, an object becomes transformative. It can be a financial opportunity, evolving with market conditions. It can embody a customer relationship, deepening with each interaction. It can represent a critical supply chain component, adapting to ensure timely delivery.

But objects can only fulfill this potential when they truly live in systems designed for vitality—not when they're trapped as frozen records in lifeless databases.

Information confined to rigid structures is merely historical. Information embodied in living objects is dynamic—constantly generating new value through meaningful interactions and evolution.

This is what Living Objects makes possible: digital ecosystems where objects thrive, where value compounds through connection, where software mirrors the organic complexity and adaptability of the natural world.

At its heart lies our enduring mission: to nurture the creative spirit in everyone.

## Principles

### Objects Remember Their Story
Living objects retain their history and context naturally. They don't struggle to recall what happened yesterday—their memory is intrinsic to their existence. This continuous memory allows for richer interactions, smarter decisions, and the ability to learn from experience.

### Objects Survive Disruption
In the Living Objects ecosystem, persistence isn't an afterthought—it's the natural state. Objects endure through system changes, updates, and even failures. This resilience creates software that grows more valuable over time rather than requiring constant rebuilding.

### Objects Change with Purpose
When objects evolve, they do so with intention and coherence. Changes aren't random or fragmented but purposeful transformations that maintain the object's integrity. This orderly evolution creates systems that can adapt without breaking, grow without confusion.

### Objects Work Together Harmoniously
Living objects collaborate without conflict. They communicate through clear messages rather than fighting over shared resources. This natural cooperation scales effortlessly, creating systems that grow more capable instead of more complicated.

### Objects Evolve Where They Live
There's no separation between an object's definition and its reality. Living objects grow and change in their native environment, allowing for continuous improvement without disruption. The code isn't distant from the living system—it's an integral part of it.

### Objects Remain Accessible
Living objects are never beyond reach. They can be observed, understood, and guided at any moment. When problems arise, you're not left guessing—you can see exactly what's happening and make adjustments in real-time, while the system continues to operate.

### Objects Connect with the World
Living objects don't exist in isolation. They naturally communicate with external systems, respond to events, and integrate with the broader digital ecosystem. This connectivity makes them powerful contributors to complex business processes and customer experiences.

## Final Note

Living Objects isn't just a technical approach. It's a fundamental shift in how we create digital value. It enables systems that truly live—that remain responsive, adaptable, and kind to everyone who interacts with them. It closes the gap between vision and reality.

Most importantly, it nurtures the creative spirit in everyone who touches the system—whether developer, operator, or end user.

Join us in building systems that live.
