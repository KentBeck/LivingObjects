# Pile Package

This package consolidates the core and classes packages into a single "pile" to avoid circular dependencies.

## Migration Status

We've successfully:
- Created the pile package with all necessary functionality from core and classes
- Removed the original source files from core and classes
- Added compatibility layers in core/deprecated.go and classes/deprecated.go
- Updated imports in other packages to use the pile package
- Made the build work

## Known Issues

The following issues need to be addressed in follow-up PRs:

1. Some tests are failing because not all compatibility functions have been added
2. The demo is not working due to stack issues
3. Not all VM functionality has been fully tested
4. The compatibility layers should eventually be removed when all code is fully migrated

## Benefits

- Eliminated circular dependencies between core and classes
- Simplified object implementation
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved code organization

## Next Steps

1. Fix failing tests
2. Fix the demo
3. Update remaining parts of the codebase to use pile directly
4. Eventually remove the compatibility layers
