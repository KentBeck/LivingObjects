# Living Objects Implementation Plan

## Strategic Goal: Demonstrate Living Objects Vision

Build a **correct, complete Smalltalk implementation** that demonstrates all fundamental attributes of Living Objects - persistence, transactions, distribution, and LSP integration - to attract attention and resources for the full vision.

## Core Strategy

**Show, Don't Tell**: Rather than pursuing performance optimization, focus on demonstrating the unique value propositions of Living Objects through a working system that showcases:

1. **Objects that persist** - Simple but correct object persistence
2. **Objects that transact** - Basic ACID transactions  
3. **Objects that distribute** - Network-transparent messaging
4. **Objects that integrate** - LSP-based development

Performance can come later with resources. The goal now is to prove the vision.

## Phase 1: Complete Smalltalk Foundation âœ… 90% COMPLETE
**Goal: Correct Smalltalk-80 implementation as the foundation**

### Current Status
- âœ… Object model unified with TaggedValue
- âœ… Method lookup and execution working correctly  
- âœ… Basic blocks and closures implemented
- âœ… Exception hierarchy established
- âœ… Logging and debugging infrastructure
- ðŸ”„ 59/62 expression tests passing

### Immediate Completion Tasks
- [ ] Fix remaining 3 expression test failures
- [ ] Complete parser for array literals and keyword messages
- [ ] Implement basic class creation
- [ ] Add minimal SUnit testing framework
- [ ] Create simple REPL for demonstrations

**Deliverable**: Working Smalltalk that can run basic programs and tests

## Phase 2: Persistence Demonstration
**Goal: Show objects that truly live across time**

### Minimal Viable Persistence
- [ ] Simple object serialization to disk
- [ ] Automatic save on object modification
- [ ] Transparent load on object access
- [ ] Basic object identity preservation
- [ ] Simple crash recovery

### Demo Scenarios
```smalltalk
"Objects persist automatically"
person := Person name: 'Alice' age: 30.
"System crashes here"
"Restart system"
person name  "Returns 'Alice' - object lived!"
```

**Deliverable**: Video demo showing objects surviving system restart

## Phase 3: Transaction Demonstration  
**Goal: Show objects with ACID guarantees**

### Minimal Transaction Support
- [ ] Simple transaction begin/commit/rollback
- [ ] Basic isolation between transactions
- [ ] Optimistic concurrency with conflict detection
- [ ] Transaction log for durability

### Demo Scenarios
```smalltalk
"Transactions protect object integrity"
Transaction begin.
account1 withdraw: 100.
account2 deposit: 100.
"System crashes here - no money lost!"
Transaction commit.
```

**Deliverable**: Blog post with code examples showing transactional safety

## Phase 4: LSP Integration
**Goal: Show modern development experience**

### Basic LSP Features
- [ ] Minimal LSP server in Smalltalk
- [ ] Syntax highlighting
- [ ] Auto-completion for methods
- [ ] Go to definition
- [ ] Basic error reporting

### Demo Scenarios
- Edit Smalltalk in VS Code with full IntelliSense
- Live object inspection from any editor
- Refactoring across multiple files
- Integrated test running

**Deliverable**: Screen recording of VS Code + Living Objects development

## Phase 5: Distribution Demonstration
**Goal: Show objects that communicate across space**

### Minimal Distribution Features  
- [ ] Simple object proxy for remote objects
- [ ] TCP-based message passing
- [ ] Basic service discovery
- [ ] Transparent remote messaging

### Demo Scenarios
```smalltalk
"Objects communicate across network"
remoteCounter := Counter onHost: 'server.local'.
remoteCounter increment.
remoteCounter value  "Returns 1 from remote object"
```

**Deliverable**: Live demo of distributed counter application

## Resource Attraction Strategy

### 1. Technical Demonstrations
Each phase produces a concrete demonstration that shows a unique capability:
- **Persistence**: "Look, objects that never die!"
- **Transactions**: "Look, perfect data integrity!"
- **LSP**: "Look, Smalltalk in your favorite editor!"
- **Distribution**: "Look, objects across the network!"

### 2. Content Creation
- **Blog Series**: "Building Living Objects" - one post per phase
- **Videos**: Screen recordings of each unique feature
- **Talks**: Conference presentations on the vision
- **Code**: Open source with clear examples

### 3. Community Engagement
- **Smalltalk Community**: Show at ESUG, Camp Smalltalk
- **Modern Developers**: Show LSP integration at VS Code meetups
- **Database Community**: Show transactions at distributed systems conferences
- **Start-up Community**: Position as platform for next-gen applications

### 4. Strategic Partnerships
Target potential partners/investors by demonstrating:
- **For Enterprises**: Transactional safety for business logic
- **For Researchers**: Platform for distributed computing research  
- **For Educators**: Modern Smalltalk for teaching OOP
- **For Start-ups**: Rapid development with persistent objects

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All expression tests pass
- [ ] Can run simple Smalltalk programs
- [ ] Basic REPL working
- [ ] First blog post published

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] Objects persist across restarts
- [ ] Persistence demo video created
- [ ] 100+ GitHub stars
- [ ] First external contributor

### Phase 3 Complete When:
- [ ] ACID transactions working
- [ ] Transaction safety blog post viral (1000+ views)
- [ ] Conference talk accepted
- [ ] Serious inquiries from potential users

### Phase 4 Complete When:
- [ ] VS Code extension published
- [ ] 1000+ extension installs
- [ ] Featured in VS Code marketplace
- [ ] Partnership discussions started

### Phase 5 Complete When:
- [ ] Distributed demo running
- [ ] First production user
- [ ] Funding conversations active
- [ ] Core team forming

## Implementation Priorities

### DO Focus On:
- **Correctness** over performance
- **Demonstrations** over documentation  
- **Unique features** over common features
- **User experience** over internal elegance
- **Working code** over perfect code

### DON'T Focus On:
- Performance optimization (yet)
- Complex GC algorithms
- Advanced compiler optimizations  
- Feature completeness
- Production readiness

## Technical Approach

### Keep It Simple
- File-based persistence is fine for demos
- Single-threaded is fine for demos
- Simple networking is fine for demos
- Basic LSP subset is fine for demos

### Make It Compelling
- Each demo must show something "magical"
- Focus on developer experience
- Show real problems being solved
- Make it easy to try

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 - get all tests passing
2. **Week 2-3**: Build persistence demo
3. **Week 4**: Create content and share
4. **Month 2**: Based on feedback, proceed with transactions or LSP
5. **Month 3**: First conference presentation
6. **Month 6**: Evaluate progress and pivot if needed
