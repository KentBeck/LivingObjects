# Vision: Living Objects

## Mission Statement

Living Objects is a production-ready Smalltalk platform that brings objects to life across time and space - combining the elegance and live programming experience of Smalltalk-80 with modern infrastructure capabilities: LSP-based tooling, transactional memory, terabyte-scale persistence, and distributed computing.

## Core Vision

### Why "Living Objects"?

In Living Objects, objects truly live - they persist across time through transactions and storage, they communicate across space through distributed computing, and they evolve dynamically through live programming. Objects aren't just data structures; they are living entities with continuous existence, behavior, and relationships.

### The Platform We're Building

Living Objects is a complete Smalltalk ecosystem that delivers:

- **Live Programming Experience**: True Smalltalk-style development with immediate feedback, object inspection, and runtime modification
- **Modern Developer Experience**: LSP-based integration with any editor/IDE, bringing Smalltalk to the mainstream development workflow
- **Enterprise-Scale Data**: Transparent persistence of terabytes of objects with ACID transactions and efficient querying
- **Distributed Computing**: Native support for multi-processing and distributed object computing across networks
- **Production Readiness**: Industrial-strength reliability, performance, and operational tooling

## Technical Architecture

### 1. High-Performance VM Core
- **Smalltalk-80 Compatible**: Full language semantics with proper blocks, exceptions, and message passing
- **Competitive Performance**: Optimized execution engine matching or exceeding other modern Smalltalk implementations
- **Memory Efficient**: Generational garbage collection and optimized object layouts

### 2. LSP-Based Development Environment
- **Universal Editor Support**: Work with Smalltalk in VS Code, IntelliJ, Emacs, Vim, or any LSP-compatible editor
- **Rich Language Services**: Auto-completion, refactoring, debugging, code navigation, and real-time error detection
- **Live Object Inspection**: Browse and modify running objects directly from any editor
- **Integrated Testing**: Seamless test execution and debugging within the development flow

### 3. Transactional Object Memory
- **ACID Transactions**: Full transactional semantics for object modifications with rollback and commit
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: High-performance concurrent access with conflict detection and resolution
- **Snapshot Isolation**: Multiple consistent views of object state for different transaction scopes
- **Transparent Persistence**: Objects automatically persist without explicit save/load operations

### 4. Terabyte-Scale Object Storage
- **Distributed Storage**: Objects transparently distributed across multiple storage nodes
- **Efficient Indexing**: High-performance queries over billions of objects using advanced indexing
- **Incremental Persistence**: Only modified objects are persisted, minimizing I/O overhead
- **Schema Evolution**: Automatic handling of object schema changes without migration downtime

### 5. Multi-Processing & Distribution
- **Actor Model**: Objects as actors with asynchronous message passing across process boundaries
- **Network Transparency**: Send messages to remote objects as naturally as local objects
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic failover, replication, and recovery across distributed nodes
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic object migration for optimal resource utilization

## Key Differentiators

### What Makes This Unique

1. **Smalltalk Meets Modern Tooling**: First Smalltalk with full LSP integration, bringing the language to modern development environments

2. **Transactional Everything**: All object modifications are transactional by default, eliminating data consistency bugs

3. **Unlimited Scale**: Seamlessly work with terabytes of objects as if they were in local memory

4. **Network-Native Objects**: Objects naturally exist and communicate across distributed systems

5. **Zero-Impedance Persistence**: No ORM, no serialization - objects just exist and persist transparently
