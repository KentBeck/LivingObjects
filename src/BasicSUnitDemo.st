"Basic SUnit Demonstration
This shows the SUnit framework concepts using simple expressions
that can be evaluated by the current VM"

"=== SUnit Framework Demonstration ==="

"1. Basic Test Concept:"
"A test is an expression that should evaluate to true"
"Example: 3 + 4 = 7 should be true"
3 + 4 = 7.

"2. Assertion Concept:"
"An assertion checks if a condition is true"
"If true, test passes. If false, test fails."
"Example assertions:"
2 + 2 = 4.     "Should pass"
5 > 3.         "Should pass"
'hello' size = 5.  "Should pass"

"3. Test Failure Concept:"
"When an assertion fails, it should signal a TestFailure"
"Example: 2 + 2 = 5 should fail"

"4. Test Suite Concept:"
"Multiple related tests grouped together"
"Arithmetic tests:"
1 + 1 = 2.
3 * 4 = 12.
10 / 2 = 5.

"String tests:"
'a' , 'b' = 'ab'.
'test' size = 4.

"5. Test Result Concept:"
"Track how many tests passed, failed, or had errors"
"Example result: 8 tests run, 7 passed, 1 failed, 0 errors"

"=== Current VM Expression Test Results ==="

"These expressions work with the current C++ VM:"
"Arithmetic: " 
3 + 4.        "= 7"
10 - 3.       "= 7" 
6 * 7.        "= 42"
20 / 4.       "= 5"

"Comparison:"
3 < 5.        "= true"
7 > 2.        "= true"
3 = 3.        "= true"
4 ~= 5.       "= true"

"String operations:"
'hello' , ' world'.  "= 'hello world'"
'hello' size.        "= 5"

"Variables:"
"| x | x := 42. x"   "= 42"

"Blocks:"
"[3 + 4] value"      "= 7"

"Arrays:"
"Array new: 3"       "Creates array of size 3"
"#(1 2 3) at: 2"     "= 2"

"=== SUnit Framework Benefits ==="

"1. Automated Testing: Run many tests quickly"
"2. Regression Detection: Know when changes break existing code"
"3. Documentation: Tests show how code should work"
"4. Confidence: Make changes knowing tests will catch problems"
"5. Test-Driven Development: Write tests first, then code"

"=== Next Steps ==="

"To fully demonstrate SUnit, we need:"
"1. Smalltalk class loading in the VM"
"2. Method dispatch for test methods"
"3. Exception handling for test failures"
"4. String formatting for test reports"

"The SUnit framework classes are ready:"
"- TestCase: Base class for tests"
"- TestResult: Tracks test outcomes"  
"- TestSuite: Groups related tests"
"- TestRunner: Executes tests and reports results"
"- ExpressionTest: Comprehensive expression tests"
