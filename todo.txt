Milestone 2: Implement enough to run tests. This requires closures, exceptions, collections.

Milestone 3: Run the compiler in process so we can communicate changes via strings instead of compiled code.

Milestone 4: Fully self-hosted server. This requires all the networking stuff be written in Server Smalltalk.

To do:
* Optimize sizeof(Object). Maybe write a test for it.
  * Singleton True & False
* Class as a primitive instead of a bytecode
* Invoke primitives after lookup
* Fallback from primitive to regular method
* Bytecode assembler

Done:
Milestone 1: Implement enough to run 2+3. Everything is externally compiled.
